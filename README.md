Just a Converter
I used very basic technology for this project. I used modules pyttsx3, PyPDF2 and pdfplumber to accomplish this basic text to speech converter.
I have uploaded a sample pdf file along with the main.py 
the commented lines in the for loop at the bottom end are for changing voice. There were 3 voices when I checked. So, we can change the voice by changing the index \
like we play with lists.

Thank you. :)
